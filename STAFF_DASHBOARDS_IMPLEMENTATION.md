# Staff Dashboards Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of specialized staff dashboards for the Qlib trading platform. The system provides role-based interfaces for different staff types, enabling efficient internal operations and customer support.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Staff Types and Interfaces** (`/frontend/src/types/staff.ts`)
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all staff-related data structures
   - Defines user roles, permissions, and dashboard metrics
   - Includes interfaces for KYC applications, trading models, support tickets, and system alerts

2. **Dashboard Router** (`/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`)
   - Enhanced routing logic to direct users to appropriate staff dashboards
   - Supports both role-based and userType-based routing
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing customer/trader dashboards

3. **Specialized Staff Dashboards**
   - KYCStaffDashboard: Document review and compliance workflows
   - TradingAgentDashboard: Portfolio management and trading operations

## Integration with Test Account System

The staff dashboards integrate seamlessly with the existing test account system:

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with staff credentials
2. `useAuthStore` validates against `TestAccountService`
3. User object includes both `role` and `userType` properties
4. `Dashboard.tsx` routes based on `userType` for staff members
5. Appropriate staff dashboard loads with user permissions

### Test Accounts Available
- **KYC Staff**: Jennifer Kim (kyc.staff@test.com)
- **Trading Agent**: Alex Rodriguez (agent@test.com)
- **IT Admin**: Chris Park (admin@test.com)
- **Support Staff**: Lisa Wang (support@test.com)

### Permissions System
Each staff type has specific permissions defined in the test account:
- KYC Staff: `['review_kyc', 'approve_accounts', 'access_customer_data', 'generate_compliance_reports']`
- Trading Agent: `['execute_trades', 'access_advanced_tools', 'manage_client_portfolios', 'view_market_data']`
- IT Admin: `['system_admin', 'user_management', 'security_monitoring', 'platform_configuration', 'audit_access']`
- Support Staff: `['access_customer_accounts', 'view_support_tickets', 'escalate_issues', 'access_knowledge_base']`
