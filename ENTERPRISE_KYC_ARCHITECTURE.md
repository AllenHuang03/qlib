# Enterprise KYC Architecture - Production Requirements

## Current State vs Production Requirements

### 🔍 **Issues Identified:**

1. **Document Upload & Facial Recognition** → Manual review required → **CRM/ERP Integration needed**
2. **Email/Phone Verification** → Requires reCAPTCHA and Google Authenticator
3. **No Real Backend** → Mock responses won't scale for real customers

## 🏗️ **Enterprise Architecture Required**

### 1. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
- **Salesforce** or **HubSpot** integration

### 2. **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**
- **SAP** or **Oracle NetSuite** integration  
- **Financial compliance tracking**
- **Audit trail maintenance** (AUSTRAC requirements)
- **Risk scoring** and customer segmentation

### 3. **Third-Party KYC Services**
```yaml
Document Verification:
  - Jumio
  - Onfido  
  - Sum & Substance (Australian specialist)

Identity Verification:
  - GreenID (Australian DVS access)
  - Experian CrossCore
  - ID Matrix

AML/CTF Screening:
  - World-Check (Thomson Reuters)
  - Dow Jones Risk & Compliance
  - LexisNexis Bridger XG
```

### 4. **Authentication & Security**
```yaml
reCAPTCHA:
  - Google reCAPTCHA v3
  - Cloudflare Turnstile
  
Multi-Factor Authentication:
  - Google Authenticator integration
  - SMS via Twilio/AWS SNS
  - Email via SendGrid/AWS SES
  
Fraud Detection:
  - Device fingerprinting
  - IP geolocation
  - Behavioral analytics
```

## 🚀 **Quick Demo Fix for Current Issue**

For immediate testing, let me fix the document upload status issue:

```typescript
// Temporary fix to enable demo progression
const handleDemoProgressionFix = () => {
  // Force mark document as verified for demo
  setUploadedDocuments(prev => prev.map(doc => ({ ...doc, status: 'verified' })));
};
```

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

### Short Term (Demo/MVP):
- Fix current document upload issue
- Complete demo flow with mock services
- Present to stakeholders for funding approval

### Long Term (Production):
- Implement full enterprise architecture
- Partner with Australian fintech compliance specialists
- Budget $500K+ for proper production system
